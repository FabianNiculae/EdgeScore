# EdgeScore


Cities of the future will be smarter, with services being driven by citizens
and adapted dynamically with a goal of ensuring higher efficiency and
safety. Towards this vision, Internet-of-Things (IoT) collect data from the
city to provide more information about the context and operate more smartly.
However, processing the data generated by these sensors may not take place
on the sensors due to their resource limitations. Hence, there is a need for
edge computing infrastructure. As a densely deployed city infrastructure,
street poles can be a promising candidate. In this study, we consider such
a system and design an algorithm to decide where the edge servers should
be placed to minimise costs without affecting latency and processing time
of the edge servers. Using the data on traffic light locations for Enschede,
we analyse the performance of our algorithm in comparison to a simple
baseline, which places the edge servers on randomly-selected street poles.
Our numerical analysis shows that total costs and number of edge servers
deployed can decrease significantly compared to the baseline.
Additional Key Words and Phrases: Edge computing, internet of things, edge
servers, traffic lights.
